# My Linux Setup (As of October 12, 2024)

## Distro
I'm using Fedora 40

## Desktop Enviornment
I am currently using Gnome 46. Although I have plans to switch to KDE because Gnome feels a bit slow on my laptop. KDE also has more inbuilt settings like touchpad scroll speed which Gnome lacks. Apart from that I feel like Gnome is a pretty great desktop enviornment, with it's large ecosystem of GTK3/4 apps.

## Shell
I use the shell that comes by default with Fedora. It's none other than the good ol' bash shell.

## Editor
I use Sublime Text for editing Markdown, quickly writing up scripts and such. It's a great editor, it's fast and responsive and has a nice plugin repository. 
For more complex tasks like making apps using React and Flutter, I use VSCode. I also occasionally use Neovim, mostly when I'm editing things from the terminal

## Gnome Extensions
Here's a list of the Gnome extensions I use:
- Blur my shell
- Caffeine
- Clipboard Indicator
- gSnap
- Sleep Through Notifications
- User Themes

Fedora Specific System Extensions:
- Apps Menu
- Background Logo
- Window List
